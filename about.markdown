Hi! I'm Erick Galinkin, AI research lead at Rapid7 and PhD candidate at Drexel University!

I'm interested in the interplay between game theory and computer security, but secretly it's all a front to make progress on fundamental issues in computability theory and algorithmic learning theory.
I also think information geometry is one of the keys to unlocking those secrets, so I do research in that too!
