# Who I am
Erick Galinkin, Principal AI researcher at Rapid7 and PhD candidate in computer science at Drexel University!

I'm interested in the interplay between **decision theory** and **computer security**, specifically as a way to improve security automation and ease the burden of decision making in security.
Secretly it's a front to make progress on issues in **computability** and **learning theory**.
I believe that **geometry** is a powerful mathematical tool for these problems, and particularly the resolution of uncertainty, so I also aim to work on issues in that field.

I'm deeply invested in **AI ethics** -- I spent a year with the [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](montrealethics.ai) working on lowering the barrier to entry for algorithmic accountability, and I co-hosted the first ever algorithmic bias bug bounty with the DEF CON AI Village and Twitter.

The philosophy that underpins all of my research is that computers are, and should be, a tool for improving life for everyone.
