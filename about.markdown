# Who I am
Erick Galinkin, Principal AI researcher at Rapid7 and PhD candidate in computer science at Drexel University.
I've also built a number of courses with Udacity:
* [Security Architect](https://www.udacity.com/course/security-architect-nanodegree--nd992)
* [Machine Learning Engineer for Microsoft Azure](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-for-microsoft-azure-nanodegree--nd00333)
* [DevOps with Microsoft Azure](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-devops-using-microsoft-azure-nanodegree--nd082)

I'm interested in the interplay between **decision theory** and **computer security**, specifically as a way to improve security automation and ease the burden of decision making in security.
Secretly it's a front to make progress on issues in **computability** and **learning theory**.
I believe that **geometry** is a powerful mathematical tool for these problems, and particularly the resolution of uncertainty, so I also aim to work on issues in that field.

Because of how much attention artificial intelligence has received and my background in security, I'm also pursuing research in **Security of AI**. 
This includes research on privacy attacks, poisoning attacks, and yes, adversarial examples.

I'm deeply invested in **AI ethics** -- I spent a year with the [Montreal AI Ethics Institute](montrealethics.ai) working on lowering the barrier to entry for algorithmic accountability, and I co-hosted the first ever algorithmic bias bug bounty with the DEF CON AI Village and Twitter.
Further, I'm interested in **AI Policy and Regulation** both as a vehicle for advancing AI ethics principles and as part of my advocacy work for Rapid7.

The philosophy that underpins all of my research is that computers are, and should be, a tool for improving life for everyone.
